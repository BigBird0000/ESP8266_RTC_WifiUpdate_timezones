Public Wi-Fi database. Geo-Location API. Public API of position by Wi-Fi (MAC, BSSID).

Wi-Fi

I would like to introduce public API implementation of Wi-Fi Geo-Location database. There are on the Internet a lot of sources of Wi-Fi positions but all of them have disadvantages of small data sets or inaccurate data.

This database could be interesting for any applications that have to get accurate user location via Wi-Fi information.

Basis compilation has following open databases:

    openBmap (Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0)
    OpenWifi.su (GNU free documentation license)

At this moment database contains about 34M+ of records and it always getting new data.

If you have any reliable source of Wi-Fi data, please share it with me via e-mail alex@mylnikov.org.

API doesn't contains any hidden limitations or usage fees. All the data is provided "as is" and free without any money contribution.

Specifications of Public Geo-Location API

Request paths:

http://api.mylnikov.org/geolocation/wifi?v=1.1&data=open&bssid={wifi-bssid}

https://api.mylnikov.org/geolocation/wifi?v=1.1&data=open&bssid={wifi-bssid}

{wifi-bssid} - BSSID of Wi-Fi AP (MAC address of network's AP card)

BSSID variants input:

    A0:F3:C1:3B:6F:90
    A0F3C13B6F90
    a0f3c13b6f90
    A0-F3-C1-3B-6F-90
    a0-f3-c1-3b-6f-90

Example:

https://api.mylnikov.org/geolocation/wifi?v=1.1&data=open&bssid=00:0C:42:1F:65:E9

Response example:

{"result":200, "data":{"range": 140, "lan": "60.05205150", "lon": "30.33848000", "signal": "-80"}}
Field "result" contains 200 if Wi-Fi was found, otherwise it returns 404

Description of successful response:

    lat - latitude
    lon - longitude
    range - accuracy of result in meters

Refined location (Beta) multiple Wi-Fis

This section describes opportunity to fetch geo-location by multiple amount of Wi-Fi APs. It has the syntax: User sends the set of APs with them signal straight levels and server returns location coordinate. The request string should be wrapped with Base64

Request paths:

http://api.mylnikov.org/geolocation/wifi?v=1.1&data=open&search={base64-search-string}

https://api.mylnikov.org/geolocation/wifi?v=1.1&data=open&search={base64-search-string}

{base64-search-string} - Base64 encoded string with following properties:

Example of input string:

"28:28:5d:d6:39:8a,-76;90:94:e4:ac:12:26,-80"

bssid,SS;bssid1,SS1

SS - Signal Strength

Demo

The web-site https://find-wifi.mylnikov.org/ has a demo visualisation API results on map.

Licensing

Statements of the API project:

    Open data Geo-Location API  that licensed with  MIT License. All the request should contain key "data=open" key. The data from comes from the open source written above.
    Any data from Geo-Location API is presented "as is".
    Any usage of Geo-Location API are done by a final user without any stated guarantees and specific condition.
    Usage liable of any data fetched from API fully lies on a final user activity and could be never wired with Geo-Location API service.

API database contains about 34.5M+ records. Usage of API is fully free of charge.

P.S.

I you need full database of Wi-Fi in CSV format you can download here. The compilation has updated dump of all the sources of the API.

I'll be happy to give you any help via e-mail alex@mylnikov.org.

Here are some application that could let you view about accuracy of the API. Feel free to install!
